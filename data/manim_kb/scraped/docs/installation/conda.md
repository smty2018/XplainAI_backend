## Required Dependencies ¶

There are several package managers that work with conda packages,
namely conda , mamba and pixi .

After installing your package manager, you can create a new environment and install manim inside by running

conda / mamba

```
# if you want to use mamba, just replace conda below with mamba

conda
 
create
 
-n
 
my-manim-environment
conda
 
activate
 
my-manim-environment
conda
 
install
 
-c
 
conda-forge
 
manim
```

pixi

```
pixi
 
init
pixi
 
add
 
manim
```

Since all dependencies (except LaTeX) are handled by conda, you don’t need to worry
about needing to install additional dependencies.

## Optional Dependencies ¶

In order to make use of Manim’s interface to LaTeX to, for example, render
equations, LaTeX has to be installed as well. Note that this is an optional
dependency: if you don’t intend to use LaTeX, you don’t have to install it.

Recommendations on how to install LaTeX on different operating systems
can be found in our local installation guide .

## Working with Manim ¶

At this point, you should have a working installation of Manim, head

how to make your own Manimations !
