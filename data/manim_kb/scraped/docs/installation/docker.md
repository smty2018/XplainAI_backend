# Docker ¶

The community maintains a docker image, which can be found on DockerHub .
For our image manimcommunity/manim , there are the following tags:

- latest : the most recent version corresponding
to the main branch ,
- stable : the latest released version (according to the releases page ),
- vX.Y.Z : any particular released version (according to the releases page ).

Note

When using Manim’s CLI within a Docker container, some flags like -p (preview file) and -f (show output file in the file browser)
are not supported.

Note

The Docker image ships with a minimal TeX Live installation. In particular, ctex is not installed by default. If your scenes rely on TexTemplateLibrary.ctex , install it in the container via tlmgr install ctex .

## Basic usage of the Docker container ¶

Assuming that you can access the docker installation on your system
from a terminal (bash / PowerShell) via docker , you can
render a scene CircleToSquare in a file test_scenes.py with the following command.

```
docker
 
run
 
--rm
 
-it
 
-v
 
"/full/path/to/your/directory:/manim"
 
manimcommunity/manim
 
manim
 
-qm
 
test_scenes.py
 
CircleToSquare
```

Tip

For Linux users there might be permission problems when letting the
user in the container write to the mounted volume.
Add --user="$(id -u):$(id -g)" to the docker CLI arguments
to prevent the creation of output files not belonging to your user.

Instead of using the “throwaway container” approach outlined
above, you can also create a named container that you can
modify to your liking. First, run

```
docker
 
run
 
-it
 
--name
 
my-manim-container
 
-v
 
"/full/path/to/your/directory:/manim"
 
manimcommunity/manim
 
bash
```

to obtain an interactive shell inside your container allowing you
to, e.g., install further dependencies (like texlive packages using tlmgr ). Exit the container as soon as you are satisfied. Then,
before using it, start the container by running

```
docker
 
start
 
my-manim-container
```

which starts the container in the background. Then, to render
a scene CircleToSquare in a file test_scenes.py , run

```
docker
 
exec
 
-it
 
my-manim-container
 
manim
 
-qm
 
test_scenes.py
 
CircleToSquare
```

## Running JupyterLab via Docker ¶

Another alternative to using the Docker image is to spin up a
local JupyterLab instance. To do that, simply run

```
docker
 
run
 
-it
 
-p
 
8888
:8888
 
manimcommunity/manim
 
jupyter
 
lab
 
--ip
=
0
.0.0.0
```

and then follow the instructions in the terminal.
