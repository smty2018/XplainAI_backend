# Write ¶

Qualified name: manim.animation.creation.Write

class Write ( mobject = None , * args , use_override = True , ** kwargs ) [source] ¶ Bases: DrawBorderThenFill Simulate hand-writing a Text or hand-drawing a VMobject . Examples Example: ShowWrite ¶ from manim import * class ShowWrite ( Scene ): def construct ( self ): self . play ( Write ( Text ( "Hello" , font_size = 144 ))) class ShowWrite(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        self.play(Write(Text("Hello", font_size=144))) Example: ShowWriteReversed ¶ from manim import * class ShowWriteReversed ( Scene ): def construct ( self ): self . play ( Write ( Text ( "Hello" , font_size = 144 ), reverse = True , remover = False )) class ShowWriteReversed(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        self.play(Write(Text("Hello", font_size=144), reverse=True, remover=False)) Tests Check that creating empty Write animations works: >>> from manim import Write , Text >>> Write ( Text ( '' )) Write(Text('')) Methods begin Begin the animation. finish Finish the animation. reverse_submobjects Attributes run_time Parameters : vmobject ( VMobject | OpenGLVMobject ) rate_func ( Callable [ [ float ] , float ] ) reverse ( bool ) _original__init__ ( vmobject , rate_func = <function linear> , reverse = False , **kwargs ) ¶ Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature. Parameters : vmobject ( VMobject | OpenGLVMobject ) rate_func ( Callable [ [ float ] , float ] ) reverse ( bool ) Return type : None begin ( ) [source] ¶ Begin the animation. This method is called right as an animation is being played. As much
initialization as possible, especially any mobject copying, should live in this
method. Return type : None finish ( ) [source] ¶ Finish the animation. This method gets called when the animation is over. Return type : None
