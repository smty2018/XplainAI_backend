# Polygram ¶

Qualified name: manim.mobject.geometry.polygram.Polygram

class Polygram ( * vertex_groups , color = ManimColor('#58C4DD') , ** kwargs ) [source] ¶ Bases: VMobject A generalized Polygon , allowing for disconnected sets of edges. Parameters : vertex_groups ( Point3DLike_Array ) – The groups of vertices making up the Polygram . The first vertex in each group is repeated to close the shape.
Each point must be 3-dimensional: [x,y,z] color ( ManimColor ) – The color of the Polygram . kwargs ( Any ) – Forwarded to the parent constructor. Examples Example: PolygramExample ¶ from manim import * import numpy as np class PolygramExample ( Scene ): def construct ( self ): hexagram = Polygram ( [[ 0 , 2 , 0 ], [ - np . sqrt ( 3 ), - 1 , 0 ], [ np . sqrt ( 3 ), - 1 , 0 ]], [[ - np . sqrt ( 3 ), 1 , 0 ], [ 0 , - 2 , 0 ], [ np . sqrt ( 3 ), 1 , 0 ]], ) self . add ( hexagram ) dot = Dot () self . play ( MoveAlongPath ( dot , hexagram ), run_time = 5 , rate_func = linear ) self . remove ( dot ) self . wait () import numpy as np

    def construct(self):
        hexagram = Polygram(
            [[0, 2, 0], [-np.sqrt(3), -1, 0], [np.sqrt(3), -1, 0]],
            [[-np.sqrt(3), 1, 0], [0, -2, 0], [np.sqrt(3), 1, 0]],
        )
        self.add(hexagram)

        dot = Dot()
        self.play(MoveAlongPath(dot, hexagram), run_time=5, rate_func=linear)
        self.remove(dot)
        self.wait() Methods get_vertex_groups Gets the vertex groups of the Polygram . get_vertices Gets the vertices of the Polygram . round_corners Rounds off the corners of the Polygram . Attributes always Call a method on a mobject every frame. animate Used to animate the application of any method of self . animation_overrides color depth The depth of the mobject. fill_color If there are multiple colors (for gradient) this returns the first one height The height of the mobject. n_points_per_curve sheen_factor stroke_color width The width of the mobject. _original__init__ ( * vertex_groups , color = ManimColor('#58C4DD') , ** kwargs ) ¶ Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature. Parameters : vertex_groups ( Point3DLike_Array ) color ( ParsableManimColor ) kwargs ( Any ) get_vertex_groups ( ) [source] ¶ Gets the vertex groups of the Polygram . Returns : The list of vertex groups of the Polygram . Return type : list[ Point3D_Array ] Examples >>> poly = Polygram ([ ORIGIN , RIGHT , UP , LEFT + UP ], [ LEFT , LEFT + UP , 2 * LEFT ]) >>> groups = poly . get_vertex_groups () >>> len ( groups ) 2 >>> groups [ 0 ] array([[ 0.,  0.,  0.], [ 1.,  0.,  0.], [ 0.,  1.,  0.], [-1.,  1.,  0.]]) >>> groups [ 1 ] array([[-1.,  0.,  0.], [-1.,  1.,  0.], [-2.,  0.,  0.]]) get_vertices ( ) [source] ¶ Gets the vertices of the Polygram . Returns : The vertices of the Polygram . Return type : numpy.ndarray Examples >>> sq = Square () >>> sq . get_vertices () array([[ 1.,  1.,  0.], [-1.,  1.,  0.], [-1., -1.,  0.], [ 1., -1.,  0.]]) round_corners ( radius = 0.5 , evenly_distribute_anchors = False , components_per_rounded_corner = 2 ) [source] ¶ Rounds off the corners of the Polygram . Parameters : radius ( float | list [ float ] ) – The curvature of the corners of the Polygram . evenly_distribute_anchors ( bool ) – Break long line segments into proportionally-sized segments. components_per_rounded_corner ( int ) – The number of points used to represent the rounded corner curve. Return type : Self See also RoundedRectangle Note If radius is supplied as a single value, then the same radius
will be applied to all corners.  If radius is a list, then the
individual values will be applied sequentially, with the first
corner receiving radius[0] , the second corner receiving radius[1] , etc.  The radius list will be repeated as necessary. The components_per_rounded_corner value is provided so that the
fidelity of the rounded corner may be fine-tuned as needed.  2 is
an appropriate value for most shapes, however a larger value may be
need if the rounded corner is particularly large.  2 is the minimum
number allowed, representing the start and end of the curve.  3 will
result in a start, middle, and end point, meaning 2 curves will be
generated. The option to evenly_distribute_anchors is provided so that the
line segments (the part part of each line remaining after rounding
off the corners) can be subdivided to a density similar to that of
the average density of the rounded corners.  This may be desirable
in situations in which an even distribution of curves is desired
for use in later transformation animations.  Be aware, though, that
enabling this option can result in an an object containing
significantly more points than the original, especially when the
rounded corner curves are small. Examples Example: PolygramRoundCorners ¶ from manim import * class PolygramRoundCorners ( Scene ): def construct ( self ): star = Star ( outer_radius = 2 ) shapes = VGroup ( star ) shapes . add ( star . copy () . round_corners ( radius = 0.1 )) shapes . add ( star . copy () . round_corners ( radius = 0.25 )) shapes . arrange ( RIGHT ) self . add ( shapes ) class PolygramRoundCorners(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        star = Star(outer_radius=2)

        shapes = VGroup(star)
        shapes.add(star.copy().round_corners(radius=0.1))
        shapes.add(star.copy().round_corners(radius=0.25))

        shapes.arrange(RIGHT)
        self.add(shapes)
