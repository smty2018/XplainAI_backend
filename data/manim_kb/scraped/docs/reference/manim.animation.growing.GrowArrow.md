Leave empty to match arrow’s color. kwargs ( Any ) Examples Example: GrowArrowExample ¶ from manim import * class GrowArrowExample ( Scene ): def construct ( self ): arrows = [ Arrow ( 2 * LEFT , 2 * RIGHT ), Arrow ( 2 * DR , 2 * UL )] VGroup ( * arrows ) . set_x ( 0 ) . arrange ( buff = 2 ) self . play ( GrowArrow ( arrows [ 0 ])) self . play ( GrowArrow ( arrows [ 1 ], point_color = RED )) class GrowArrowExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        arrows = [Arrow(2 * LEFT, 2 * RIGHT), Arrow(2 * DR, 2 * UL)]
        VGroup(*arrows).set_x(0).arrange(buff=2)
        self.play(GrowArrow(arrows[0]))
        self.play(GrowArrow(arrows[1], point_color=RED)) Methods create_starting_mobject Attributes path_arc path_func run_time _original__init__ ( arrow , point_color = None , ** kwargs ) ¶ Initialize self.
