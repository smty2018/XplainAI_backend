# manim_directive ¶

## A directive for including Manim videos in a Sphinx document ¶

When rendering the HTML documentation, the .. manim:: directive
implemented here allows to include rendered videos.

Its basic usage that allows processing inline content looks as follows:

```
..
 
manim
::
 
MyScene


    
class
 
MyScene
(
Scene
):

        
def
 
construct
(
self
):

            
...
```

It is required to pass the name of the class representing the
scene to be rendered to the directive.

As a second application, the directive can also be used to
render scenes that are defined within doctests, for example:

```
..
 
manim
::
 
DirectiveDoctestExample

    
:
ref_classes
:
 
Dot


    
>>>
 
from
 
manim
 
import
 
Create
,
 
Dot
,
 
RED
,
 
Scene

    
>>>
 
dot
 
=
 
Dot
(
color
=
RED
)

    
>>>
 
dot
.
color

    
ManimColor
(
'#FC6255'
)

    
>>>
 
class
 
DirectiveDoctestExample
(
Scene
):

    
...
     
def
 
construct
(
self
):

    
...
         
self
.
play
(
Create
(
dot
))
```

### Options ¶

Options can be passed as follows:

```
..
 
manim
::
 
<
Class
 
name
>

    
:
<
option
 
name
>
:
 
<
value
>
```

The following configuration options are supported by the
directive:

hide_source If this flag is present without argument,
the source code is not displayed above the rendered video. no_autoplay If this flag is present without argument,
the video will not autoplay. quality {‘low’, ‘medium’, ‘high’, ‘fourk’} Controls render quality of the video, in analogy to
the corresponding command line flags. save_as_gif If this flag is present without argument,
the scene is rendered as a gif. save_last_frame If this flag is present without argument,
an image representing the last frame of the scene will
be rendered and displayed, instead of a video. ref_classes A list of classes, separated by spaces, that is
rendered in a reference block after the source code. ref_functions A list of functions, separated by spaces,
that is rendered in a reference block after the source code. ref_methods A list of methods, separated by spaces,
that is rendered in a reference block after the source code.
