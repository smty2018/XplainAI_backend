# BraceBetweenPoints ¶

Qualified name: manim.mobject.svg.brace.BraceBetweenPoints

class BraceBetweenPoints ( point_1 , point_2 , direction = array([0., 0., 0.]) , ** kwargs ) [source] ¶ Bases: Brace Similar to Brace, but instead of taking a mobject it uses 2
points to place the brace. A fitting direction for the brace is
computed, but it still can be manually overridden.
If the points go from left to right, the brace is drawn from below.
Swapping the points places the brace on the opposite side. Parameters : point_1 ( Point3DLike ) – The first point. point_2 ( Point3DLike ) – The second point. direction ( Vector3DLike ) – The direction from which the brace faces towards the points. kwargs ( Any ) Examples Example: BraceBPExample ¶ from manim import * class BraceBPExample ( Scene ): def construct ( self ): p1 = [ 0 , 0 , 0 ] p2 = [ 1 , 2 , 0 ] brace = BraceBetweenPoints ( p1 , p2 ) self . play ( Create ( NumberPlane ())) self . play ( Create ( brace )) self . wait ( 2 ) class BraceBPExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        p1 = [0,0,0]
        p2 = [1,2,0]
        brace = BraceBetweenPoints(p1,p2)
        self.play(Create(NumberPlane()))
        self.play(Create(brace))
        self.wait(2) Methods Attributes always Call a method on a mobject every frame. animate Used to animate the application of any method of self . animation_overrides color depth The depth of the mobject. fill_color If there are multiple colors (for gradient) this returns the first one height The height of the mobject. n_points_per_curve sheen_factor stroke_color width The width of the mobject. _original__init__ ( point_1 , point_2 , direction = array([0., 0., 0.]) , ** kwargs ) ¶ Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature. Parameters : point_1 ( Point3DLike ) point_2 ( Point3DLike ) direction ( Vector3DLike ) kwargs ( Any )
