# Icosahedron ¶

Qualified name: manim.mobject.three\_d.polyhedra.Icosahedron

class Icosahedron ( edge_length = 1 , ** kwargs ) [source] ¶ Bases: Polyhedron An icosahedron, one of the five platonic solids. It has 20 faces, 30 edges and 12 vertices. Parameters : edge_length ( float ) – The length of an edge between any two vertices. kwargs ( Any ) Examples Example: IcosahedronScene ¶ from manim import * class IcosahedronScene ( ThreeDScene ): def construct ( self ): self . set_camera_orientation ( phi = 75 * DEGREES , theta = 30 * DEGREES ) obj = Icosahedron () self . add ( obj ) class IcosahedronScene(ThreeDScene):
    def construct(self):
        self.set_camera_orientation(phi=75 * DEGREES, theta=30 * DEGREES)
        obj = Icosahedron()
        self.add(obj) Methods Attributes always Call a method on a mobject every frame. animate Used to animate the application of any method of self . animation_overrides color depth The depth of the mobject. fill_color If there are multiple colors (for gradient) this returns the first one height The height of the mobject. n_points_per_curve sheen_factor stroke_color width The width of the mobject. _original__init__ ( edge_length = 1 , ** kwargs ) ¶ Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature. Parameters : edge_length ( float ) kwargs ( Any )
