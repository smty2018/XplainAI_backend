Qualified name: manim.animation.fading.FadeOut

class FadeOut ( mobject = None , * args , use_override = True , ** kwargs ) [source] ¶ Bases: _Fade Fade out Mobject s. Parameters : mobjects ( Mobject ) – The mobjects to be faded out. shift – The vector by which the mobject shifts while being faded out. target_position – The position to which the mobject moves while being faded out. In case another
mobject is given as target position, its center is used. scale – The factor by which the mobject is scaled while being faded out. kwargs ( Any ) Examples Example: FadeInExample ¶ from manim import * class FadeInExample ( Scene ): def construct ( self ): dot = Dot ( UP * 2 + LEFT ) self . add ( dot ) tex = Tex ( "FadeOut with " , "shift " , r " or target\_position" , " and scale" ) . scale ( 1 ) animations = [ FadeOut ( tex [ 0 ]), FadeOut ( tex [ 1 ], shift = DOWN ), FadeOut ( tex [ 2 ], target_position = dot ), FadeOut ( tex [ 3 ], scale = 0.5 ), ] self . play ( AnimationGroup ( * animations , lag_ratio = 0.5 )) class FadeInExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        dot = Dot(UP * 2 + LEFT)
        self.add(dot)
        tex = Tex(
            "FadeOut with ", "shift ", r" or target\_position", " and scale"
        ).scale(1)
        animations = [
            FadeOut(tex[0]),
            FadeOut(tex[1], shift=DOWN),
            FadeOut(tex[2], target_position=dot),
            FadeOut(tex[3], scale=0.5),
        ]
        self.play(AnimationGroup(*animations, lag_ratio=0.5)) Methods clean_up_from_scene Clean up the Scene after finishing the animation. create_target Attributes path_arc path_func run_time _original__init__ ( * mobjects , ** kwargs ) ¶ Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature. Parameters : mobjects ( Mobject ) kwargs ( Any ) Return type : None clean_up_from_scene ( scene ) [source] ¶ Clean up the Scene after finishing the animation. This includes to remove() the Animation’s Mobject if the animation is a remover. Parameters : scene ( Scene ) – The scene the animation should be cleaned up from. Return type : None
