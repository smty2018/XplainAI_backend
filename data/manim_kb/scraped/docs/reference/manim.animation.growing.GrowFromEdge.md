# GrowFromEdge ¶

Qualified name: manim.animation.growing.GrowFromEdge

class GrowFromEdge ( mobject = None , * args , use_override = True , ** kwargs ) [source] ¶ Bases: GrowFromPoint Introduce an Mobject by growing it from one of its bounding box edges. Parameters : mobject ( Mobject ) – The mobjects to be introduced. edge ( Vector3DLike ) – The direction to seek bounding box edge of mobject. point_color ( ParsableManimColor | None ) – Initial color of the mobject before growing to its full size. Leave empty to match mobject’s color. kwargs ( Any ) Examples Example: GrowFromEdgeExample ¶ from manim import * class GrowFromEdgeExample ( Scene ): def construct ( self ): squares = [ Square () for _ in range ( 4 )] VGroup ( * squares ) . set_x ( 0 ) . arrange ( buff = 1 ) self . play ( GrowFromEdge ( squares [ 0 ], DOWN )) self . play ( GrowFromEdge ( squares [ 1 ], RIGHT )) self . play ( GrowFromEdge ( squares [ 2 ], UR )) self . play ( GrowFromEdge ( squares [ 3 ], UP , point_color = RED )) class GrowFromEdgeExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        squares = [Square() for _ in range(4)]
        VGroup(*squares).set_x(0).arrange(buff=1)
        self.play(GrowFromEdge(squares[0], DOWN))
        self.play(GrowFromEdge(squares[1], RIGHT))
        self.play(GrowFromEdge(squares[2], UR))
        self.play(GrowFromEdge(squares[3], UP, point_color=RED)) Methods Attributes path_arc path_func run_time _original__init__ ( mobject , edge , point_color = None , ** kwargs ) ¶ Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature. Parameters : mobject ( Mobject ) edge ( Vector3DLike ) point_color ( ParsableManimColor | None ) kwargs ( Any )
