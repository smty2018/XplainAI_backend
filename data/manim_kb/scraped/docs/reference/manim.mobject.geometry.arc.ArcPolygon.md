Qualified name: manim.mobject.geometry.arc.ArcPolygon

class ArcPolygon ( * vertices , angle = 0.7853981633974483 , radius = None , arc_config = None , ** kwargs ) [source] ¶ Bases: VMobject A generalized polygon allowing for points to be connected with arcs. This version tries to stick close to the way Polygon is used. Points
can be passed to it directly which are used to generate the according arcs
(using ArcBetweenPoints ). An angle or radius can be passed to it to
use across all arcs, but to configure arcs individually an arc_config list
has to be passed with the syntax explained below. Parameters : vertices ( Point3DLike ) – A list of vertices, start and end points for the arc segments. angle ( float ) – The angle used for constructing the arcs. If no other parameters
are set, this angle is used to construct all arcs. radius ( float | None ) – The circle radius used to construct the arcs. If specified,
overrides the specified angle . arc_config ( list [ dict ] | None ) – When passing a dict , its content will be passed as keyword
arguments to ArcBetweenPoints . Otherwise, a list
of dictionaries containing values that are passed as keyword
arguments for every individual arc can be passed. kwargs ( Any ) – Further keyword arguments that are passed to the constructor of VMobject . arcs ¶ The arcs created from the input parameters: >>> from manim import ArcPolygon >>> ap = ArcPolygon ([ 0 , 0 , 0 ], [ 2 , 0 , 0 ], [ 0 , 2 , 0 ]) >>> ap . arcs [ArcBetweenPoints, ArcBetweenPoints, ArcBetweenPoints] Type : list Tip Two instances of ArcPolygon can be transformed properly into one
another as well. Be advised that any arc initialized with angle=0 will actually be a straight line, so if a straight section should seamlessly
transform into an arced section or vice versa, initialize the straight section
with a negligible angle instead (such as angle=0.0001 ). Note There is an alternative version ( ArcPolygonFromArcs ) that is instantiated
with pre-defined arcs.
