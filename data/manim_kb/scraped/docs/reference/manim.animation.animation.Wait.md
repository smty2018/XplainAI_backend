# Wait ¶

Qualified name: manim.animation.animation.Wait

class Wait ( mobject = None , * args , use_override = True , ** kwargs ) [source] ¶ Bases: Animation A “no operation” animation. Parameters : run_time ( float ) – The amount of time that should pass. stop_condition ( Callable [ [ ] , bool ] | None ) – A function without positional arguments that evaluates to a boolean.
The function is evaluated after every new frame has been rendered.
Playing the animation stops after the return value is truthy, or
after the specified run_time has passed. frozen_frame ( bool | None ) – Controls whether or not the wait animation is static, i.e., corresponds
to a frozen frame. If False is passed, the render loop still
progresses through the animation as usual and (among other things)
continues to call updater functions. If None (the default value),
the Scene.play() call tries to determine whether the Wait call
can be static or not itself via Scene.should_mobjects_update() . kwargs – Keyword arguments to be passed to the parent class, Animation . rate_func ( Callable [ [ float ] , float ] ) Methods begin Begin the animation. clean_up_from_scene Clean up the Scene after finishing the animation. finish Finish the animation. interpolate Set the animation progress. update_mobjects Updates things like starting_mobject, and (for Transforms) target_mobject. Attributes run_time _original__init__ ( run_time = 1 , stop_condition = None , frozen_frame = None , rate_func = <function linear> , **kwargs ) ¶ Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature. Parameters : run_time ( float ) stop_condition ( Callable [ [ ] , bool ] | None ) frozen_frame ( bool | None ) rate_func ( Callable [ [ float ] , float ] ) begin ( ) [source] ¶ Begin the animation. This method is called right as an animation is being played. As much
initialization as possible, especially any mobject copying, should live in this
method. Return type : None clean_up_from_scene ( scene ) [source] ¶ Clean up the Scene after finishing the animation. This includes to remove() the Animation’s Mobject if the animation is a remover. Parameters : scene ( Scene ) – The scene the animation should be cleaned up from. Return type : None finish ( ) [source] ¶ Finish the animation. This method gets called when the animation is over. Return type : None interpolate ( alpha ) [source] ¶ Set the animation progress. This method gets called for every frame during an animation. Parameters : alpha ( float ) – The relative time to set the animation to, 0 meaning the start, 1 meaning
the end. Return type : None update_mobjects ( dt ) [source] ¶ Updates things like starting_mobject, and (for
Transforms) target_mobject.  Note, since typically
(always?) self.mobject will have its updating
suspended during the animation, this will do
nothing to self.mobject. Parameters : dt ( float ) Return type : None
