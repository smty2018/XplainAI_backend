# Cutout ¶

Qualified name: manim.mobject.geometry.polygram.Cutout

class Cutout ( main_shape , * mobjects , ** kwargs ) [source] ¶ Bases: VMobject A shape with smaller cutouts. Parameters : main_shape ( VMobject ) – The primary shape from which cutouts are made. mobjects ( VMobject ) – The smaller shapes which are to be cut out of the main_shape . kwargs ( Any ) – Further keyword arguments that are passed to the constructor of VMobject . Warning Technically, this class behaves similar to a symmetric difference: if
parts of the mobjects are not located within the main_shape ,
these parts will be added to the resulting VMobject . Examples Example: CutoutExample ¶ from manim import * class CutoutExample ( Scene ): def construct ( self ): s1 = Square () . scale ( 2.5 ) s2 = Triangle () . shift ( DOWN + RIGHT ) . scale ( 0.5 ) s3 = Square () . shift ( UP + RIGHT ) . scale ( 0.5 ) s4 = RegularPolygon ( 5 ) . shift ( DOWN + LEFT ) . scale ( 0.5 ) s5 = RegularPolygon ( 6 ) . shift ( UP + LEFT ) . scale ( 0.5 ) c = Cutout ( s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 , s5 , fill_opacity = 1 , color = BLUE , stroke_color = RED ) self . play ( Write ( c ), run_time = 4 ) self . wait () class CutoutExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        s1 = Square().scale(2.5)
        s2 = Triangle().shift(DOWN + RIGHT).scale(0.5)
        s3 = Square().shift(UP + RIGHT).scale(0.5)
        s4 = RegularPolygon(5).shift(DOWN + LEFT).scale(0.5)
        s5 = RegularPolygon(6).shift(UP + LEFT).scale(0.5)
        c = Cutout(s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, fill_opacity=1, color=BLUE, stroke_color=RED)
        self.play(Write(c), run_time=4)
        self.wait() Methods Attributes always Call a method on a mobject every frame. animate Used to animate the application of any method of self . animation_overrides color depth The depth of the mobject. fill_color If there are multiple colors (for gradient) this returns the first one height The height of the mobject. n_points_per_curve sheen_factor stroke_color width The width of the mobject. _original__init__ ( main_shape , * mobjects , ** kwargs ) ¶ Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature. Parameters : main_shape ( VMobject ) mobjects ( VMobject ) kwargs ( Any ) Return type : None
