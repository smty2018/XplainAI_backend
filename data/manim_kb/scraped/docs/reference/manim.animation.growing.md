Classes

GrowArrow | Introduce an | Arrow | by growing it from its start toward its tip. | GrowFromCenter | Introduce an | Mobject | by growing it from its center. | GrowFromEdge | Introduce an | Mobject | by growing it from one of its bounding box edges. | GrowFromPoint | Introduce an | Mobject | by growing it from a point. | SpinInFromNothing | Introduce an | Mobject | spinning and growing it from its center.
