Classes

AnnotationDot | A dot with bigger radius and bold stroke to annotate scenes. | AnnularSector | A sector of an annulus. | Annulus | Region between two concentric | Circles | . | Arc | A circular arc. | ArcBetweenPoints | Inherits from Arc and additionally takes 2 points between which the arc is spanned. | ArcPolygon | A generalized polygon allowing for points to be connected with arcs. | ArcPolygonFromArcs | A generalized polygon allowing for points to be connected with arcs. | Circle | A circle. | CubicBezier | A cubic Bézier curve. | CurvedArrow | CurvedDoubleArrow | Dot | A circle with a very small radius. | Ellipse | A circular shape; oval, circle. | LabeledDot | A | Dot | containing a label in its center. | Sector | A sector of a circle. | TangentialArc | Construct an arc that is tangent to two intersecting lines. | TipableVMobject | Meant for shared functionality between Arc and Line.
