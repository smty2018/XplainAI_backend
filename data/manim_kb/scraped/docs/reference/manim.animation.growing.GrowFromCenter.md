Qualified name: manim.animation.growing.GrowFromCenter

class GrowFromCenter ( mobject = None , * args , use_override = True , ** kwargs ) [source] ¶ Bases: GrowFromPoint Introduce an Mobject by growing it from its center. Parameters : mobject ( Mobject ) – The mobjects to be introduced. point_color ( ParsableManimColor | None ) – Initial color of the mobject before growing to its full size. Leave empty to match mobject’s color. kwargs ( Any ) Examples Example: GrowFromCenterExample ¶ from manim import * class GrowFromCenterExample ( Scene ): def construct ( self ): squares = [ Square () for _ in range ( 2 )] VGroup ( * squares ) . set_x ( 0 ) . arrange ( buff = 2 ) self . play ( GrowFromCenter ( squares [ 0 ])) self . play ( GrowFromCenter ( squares [ 1 ], point_color = RED )) class GrowFromCenterExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        squares = [Square() for _ in range(2)]
        VGroup(*squares).set_x(0).arrange(buff=2)
        self.play(GrowFromCenter(squares[0]))
        self.play(GrowFromCenter(squares[1], point_color=RED)) Methods Attributes path_arc path_func run_time _original__init__ ( mobject , point_color = None , ** kwargs ) ¶ Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature. Parameters : mobject ( Mobject ) point_color ( ParsableManimColor | None ) kwargs ( Any )
