# VGroup ¶

Qualified name: manim.mobject.types.vectorized\_mobject.VGroup

class VGroup ( * vmobjects , ** kwargs ) [source] ¶ Bases: VMobject A group of vectorized mobjects. This can be used to group multiple VMobject instances together
in order to scale, move, … them together. Notes When adding the same mobject more than once, repetitions are ignored.
Use Mobject.copy() to create a separate copy which can then
be added to the group. Examples To add VGroup , you can either use the add() method, or use the + and += operators. Similarly, you
can subtract elements of a VGroup via remove() method, or - and -= operators: >>> from manim import Triangle , Square , VGroup >>> vg = VGroup () >>> triangle , square = Triangle (), Square () >>> vg . add ( triangle ) VGroup(Triangle) >>> vg + square # a new VGroup is constructed VGroup(Triangle, Square) >>> vg # not modified VGroup(Triangle) >>> vg += square >>> vg # modifies vg VGroup(Triangle, Square) >>> vg . remove ( triangle ) VGroup(Square) >>> vg - square # a new VGroup is constructed VGroup() >>> vg # not modified VGroup(Square) >>> vg -= square >>> vg # modifies vg VGroup() Example: ArcShapeIris ¶ from manim import * class ArcShapeIris ( Scene ): def construct ( self ): colors = [ DARK_BROWN , BLUE_E , BLUE_D , BLUE_A , TEAL_B , GREEN_B , YELLOW_E ] radius = [ 1 + rad * 0.1 for rad in range ( len ( colors ))] circles_group = VGroup () # zip(radius, color) makes the iterator [(radius[i], color[i]) for i in range(radius)] circles_group . add ( * [ Circle ( radius = rad , stroke_width = 10 , color = col ) for rad , col in zip ( radius , colors )]) self . add ( circles_group ) class ArcShapeIris(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        colors = [DARK_BROWN, BLUE_E, BLUE_D, BLUE_A, TEAL_B, GREEN_B, YELLOW_E]
        radius = [1 + rad * 0.1 for rad in range(len(colors))]

        circles_group = VGroup()

        # zip(radius, color) makes the iterator [(radius[i], color[i]) for i in range(radius)]
        circles_group.add(*[Circle(radius=rad, stroke_width=10, color=col)
                            for rad, col in zip(radius, colors)])
        self.add(circles_group) Methods add Checks if all passed elements are an instance, or iterables of VMobject and then adds them to submobjects Attributes always Call a method on a mobject every frame. animate Used to animate the application of any method of self . animation_overrides color depth The depth of the mobject. fill_color If there are multiple colors (for gradient) this returns the first one height The height of the mobject. n_points_per_curve sheen_factor stroke_color width The width of the mobject. Parameters : vmobjects ( VMobject | Iterable [ VMobject ] ) kwargs ( Any ) _original__init__ ( * vmobjects , ** kwargs ) ¶ Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature. Parameters : vmobjects ( VMobject | Iterable [ VMobject ] ) kwargs ( Any ) Return type : None add ( * vmobjects ) [source] ¶ Checks if all passed elements are an instance, or iterables of VMobject and then adds them to submobjects Parameters : vmobjects ( VMobject | Iterable [ VMobject ] ) – List or iterable of VMobjects to add Return type : VGroup Raises : TypeError – If one element of the list, or iterable is not an instance of VMobject Examples The following example shows how to add individual or multiple VMobject instances through the VGroup constructor and its .add() method. Example: AddToVGroup ¶ from manim import * class AddToVGroup ( Scene ): def construct ( self ): circle_red = Circle ( color = RED ) circle_green = Circle ( color = GREEN ) circle_blue = Circle ( color = BLUE ) circle_red . shift ( LEFT ) circle_blue . shift ( RIGHT ) gr = VGroup ( circle_red , circle_green ) gr2 = VGroup ( circle_blue ) # Constructor uses add directly self . add ( gr , gr2 ) self . wait () gr += gr2 # Add group to another self . play ( gr . animate . shift ( DOWN ), ) gr -= gr2 # Remove group self . play ( # Animate groups separately gr . animate . shift ( LEFT ), gr2 . animate . shift ( UP ), ) self . play ( #Animate groups without modification ( gr + gr2 ) . animate . shift ( RIGHT ) ) self . play ( # Animate group without component ( gr - circle_red ) . animate . shift ( RIGHT ) ) class AddToVGroup(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        circle_red = Circle(color=RED)
        circle_green = Circle(color=GREEN)
        circle_blue = Circle(color=BLUE)
        circle_red.shift(LEFT)
        circle_blue.shift(RIGHT)
        gr = VGroup(circle_red, circle_green)
        gr2 = VGroup(circle_blue) # Constructor uses add directly
        self.add(gr,gr2)
        self.wait()
        gr += gr2 # Add group to another
        self.play(
            gr.animate.shift(DOWN),
        )
        gr -= gr2 # Remove group
        self.play( # Animate groups separately
            gr.animate.shift(LEFT),
            gr2.animate.shift(UP),
        )
        self.play( #Animate groups without modification
            (gr+gr2).animate.shift(RIGHT)
        )
        self.play( # Animate group without component
            (gr-circle_red).animate.shift(RIGHT)
        ) A VGroup can be created using iterables as well. Keep in mind that all generated values from an
iterable must be an instance of VMobject . This is demonstrated below: Example: AddIterableToVGroupExample ¶ from manim import * class AddIterableToVGroupExample ( Scene ): def construct ( self ): v = VGroup ( Square (), # Singular VMobject instance [ Circle (), Triangle ()], # List of VMobject instances Dot (), ( Dot () for _ in range ( 2 )), # Iterable that generates VMobjects ) v . arrange () self . add ( v ) class AddIterableToVGroupExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        v = VGroup(
            Square(),               # Singular VMobject instance
            [Circle(), Triangle()], # List of VMobject instances
            Dot(),
            (Dot() for _ in range(2)), # Iterable that generates VMobjects
        )
        v.arrange()
        self.add(v) To facilitate this, the iterable is unpacked before its individual instances are added to the VGroup .
As a result, when you index a VGroup , you will never get back an iterable.
Instead, you will always receive VMobject instances, including those
that were part of the iterable/s that you originally added to the VGroup .
