Qualified name: manim.animation.animation.Add

class Add ( mobject = None , * args , use_override = True , ** kwargs ) [source] ¶ Bases: Animation Add Mobjects to a scene, without animating them in any other way. This
is similar to the Scene.add() method, but Add is an
animation which can be grouped into other animations. Parameters : mobjects ( Mobject ) – One Mobject or more to add to a scene. run_time ( float ) – The duration of the animation after adding the mobjects . Defaults
to 0, which means this is an instant animation without extra wait time
after adding them. **kwargs ( Any ) – Additional arguments to pass to the parent Animation class. Examples Example: DefaultAddScene ¶ from manim import * class DefaultAddScene ( Scene ): def construct ( self ): text_1 = Text ( "I was added with Add!" ) text_2 = Text ( "Me too!" ) text_3 = Text ( "And me!" ) texts = VGroup ( text_1 , text_2 , text_3 ) . arrange ( DOWN ) rect = SurroundingRectangle ( texts , buff = 0.5 ) self . play ( Create ( rect , run_time = 3.0 ), Succession ( Wait ( 1.0 ), # You can Add a Mobject in the middle of an animation... Add ( text_1 ), Wait ( 1.0 ), # ...or multiple Mobjects at once! Add ( text_2 , text_3 ), ), ) self . wait () class DefaultAddScene(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        text_1 = Text("I was added with Add!")
        text_2 = Text("Me too!")
        text_3 = Text("And me!")
        texts = VGroup(text_1, text_2, text_3).arrange(DOWN)
        rect = SurroundingRectangle(texts, buff=0.5)

        self.play(
            Create(rect, run_time=3.0),
            Succession(
                Wait(1.0),
                # You can Add a Mobject in the middle of an animation...
                Add(text_1),
                Wait(1.0),
                # ...or multiple Mobjects at once!
                Add(text_2, text_3),
            ),
        )
        self.wait() Example: AddWithRunTimeScene ¶ from manim import * class AddWithRunTimeScene ( Scene ): def construct ( self ): # A 5x5 grid of circles circles = VGroup ( * [ Circle ( radius = 0.5 ) for _ in range ( 25 )] ) . arrange_in_grid ( 5 , 5 ) self . play ( Succession ( # Add a run_time of 0.2 to wait for 0.2 seconds after # adding the circle, instead of using Wait(0.2) after Add! * [ Add ( circle , run_time = 0.2 ) for circle in circles ], rate_func = smooth , ) ) self . wait () class AddWithRunTimeScene(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        # A 5x5 grid of circles
        circles = VGroup(
            *[Circle(radius=0.5) for _ in range(25)]
        ).arrange_in_grid(5, 5)

        self.play(
            Succession(
                # Add a run_time of 0.2 to wait for 0.2 seconds after
                # adding the circle, instead of using Wait(0.2) after Add!
                *[Add(circle, run_time=0.2) for circle in circles],
                rate_func=smooth,
            )
        )
        self.wait() Methods begin Begin the animation. clean_up_from_scene Clean up the Scene after finishing the animation. finish Finish the animation. interpolate Set the animation progress. update_mobjects Updates things like starting_mobject, and (for Transforms) target_mobject. Attributes run_time _original__init__ ( * mobjects , run_time = 0.0 , ** kwargs ) ¶ Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature. Parameters : mobjects ( Mobject ) run_time ( float ) kwargs ( Any ) Return type : None begin ( ) [source] ¶ Begin the animation. This method is called right as an animation is being played. As much
initialization as possible, especially any mobject copying, should live in this
method. Return type : None clean_up_from_scene ( scene ) [source] ¶ Clean up the Scene after finishing the animation. This includes to remove() the Animation’s Mobject if the animation is a remover. Parameters : scene ( Scene ) – The scene the animation should be cleaned up from. Return type : None finish ( ) [source] ¶ Finish the animation. This method gets called when the animation is over. Return type : None interpolate ( alpha ) [source] ¶ Set the animation progress. This method gets called for every frame during an animation. Parameters : alpha ( float ) – The relative time to set the animation to, 0 meaning the start, 1 meaning
the end. Return type : None update_mobjects ( dt ) [source] ¶ Updates things like starting_mobject, and (for
Transforms) target_mobject.  Note, since typically
(always?) self.mobject will have its updating
suspended during the animation, this will do
nothing to self.mobject. Parameters : dt ( float ) Return type : None
