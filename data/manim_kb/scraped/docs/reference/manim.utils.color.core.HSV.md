Qualified name: manim.utils.color.core.HSV

class HSV ( hsv , alpha = 1.0 ) [source] ¶ Bases: ManimColor HSV Color Space Methods Attributes h hue s saturation v value Parameters : hsv ( FloatHSVLike | FloatHSVALike ) alpha ( float ) classmethod _from_internal ( value ) [source] ¶ This method is intended to be overwritten by custom color space classes
which are subtypes of ManimColor . The method constructs a new object of the given class by transforming the value
in the internal format [r,g,b,a] into a format which the constructor of the
custom class can understand. Look at HSV for an example. Parameters : value ( ManimColorInternal ) Return type : Self property _internal_space : ndarray [ tuple [ Any , ... ] , dtype [ _ScalarT ] ] ¶ This is a readonly property which is a custom representation for color space
operations. It is used for operators and can be used when implementing a custom
color space. property _internal_value : ManimColorInternal ¶ Return the internal value of the current ManimColor as an [r,g,b,a] float array. Returns : Internal color representation. Return type : ManimColorInternal
