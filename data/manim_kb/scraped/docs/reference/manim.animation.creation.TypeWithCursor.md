# TypeWithCursor ¶

Qualified name: manim.animation.creation.TypeWithCursor

class TypeWithCursor ( mobject = None , * args , use_override = True , ** kwargs ) [source] ¶ Bases: AddTextLetterByLetter Similar to AddTextLetterByLetter , but with an additional cursor mobject at the end. Parameters : time_per_char ( float ) – Frequency of appearance of the letters. cursor ( Mobject ) – Mobject shown after the last added letter. buff ( float ) – Controls how far away the cursor is to the right of the last added letter. keep_cursor_y ( bool ) – If True , the cursor’s y-coordinate is set to the center of the Text and remains the same throughout the animation. Otherwise, it is set to the center of the last added letter. leave_cursor_on ( bool ) – Whether to show the cursor after the animation. tip:: ( .. ) – This is currently only possible for class: ~.Text and not for class: ~.MathTex . text ( Text ) Examples Example: InsertingTextExample ¶ from manim import * class InsertingTextExample ( Scene ): def construct ( self ): text = Text ( "Inserting" , color = PURPLE ) . scale ( 1.5 ) . to_edge ( LEFT ) cursor = Rectangle ( color = GREY_A , fill_color = GREY_A , fill_opacity = 1.0 , height = 1.1 , width = 0.5 , ) . move_to ( text [ 0 ]) # Position the cursor self . play ( TypeWithCursor ( text , cursor )) self . play ( Blink ( cursor , blinks = 2 )) class InsertingTextExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        text = Text("Inserting", color=PURPLE).scale(1.5).to_edge(LEFT)
        cursor = Rectangle(
            color = GREY_A,
            fill_color = GREY_A,
            fill_opacity = 1.0,
            height = 1.1,
            width = 0.5,
        ).move_to(text[0]) # Position the cursor

See help(type(self)) for accurate signature. Parameters : text ( Text ) cursor ( Mobject ) buff ( float ) keep_cursor_y ( bool ) leave_cursor_on ( bool ) time_per_char ( float ) Return type : None begin ( ) [source] ¶ Begin the animation. This method is called right as an animation is being played. As much
initialization as possible, especially any mobject copying, should live in this
method. Return type : None clean_up_from_scene ( scene ) [source] ¶ Clean up the Scene after finishing the animation. This includes to remove() the Animation’s Mobject if the animation is a remover. Parameters : scene ( Scene ) – The scene the animation should be cleaned up from. Return type : None finish ( ) [source] ¶ Finish the animation. This method gets called when the animation is over. Return type : None
